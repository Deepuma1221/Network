2. Click on the "Decrypt" button.
3. Select the encrypted image file you want to decrypt.
4. Choose a destination folder to save the decrypted image.
5. Enter the same password or passphrase used for encryption to generate the AES-256 decryption key.
6. Click on the "Decrypt" or "Start" button to begin the decryption process.
7. Wait for the process to complete.
8. The decrypted image will be saved in the specified destination folder.

## 5. Security Considerations
AES-256 Image Security utilizes the AES-256 algorithm, which is widely recognized as a secure encryption standard. However, it is essential to keep the following security considerations in mind:

1. **Password Strength**: Choose a strong password or passphrase that is not easily guessable. Include a combination of upper and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
2. **Secure Storage**: Store your encrypted images and passwords in a secure location, such as an encrypted

 drive or a trusted cloud storage service.
3. **Key Management**: Ensure that you have a secure method of managing and storing your encryption keys. Losing the key will result in permanent data loss.
4. **Software Updates**: Keep AES-256 Image Security up to date by installing the latest updates and patches provided by the software developer. This helps protect against potential vulnerabilities.

## 6. Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues while using AES-256 Image Security, consider the following troubleshooting steps:

1. **Compatibility**: Ensure that your system meets the minimum requirements mentioned in Section 2 of this readme file.
2. **File Formats**: Verify that the image file you are encrypting or decrypting is in a supported format, such as JPEG, PNG, or GIF.
3. **Error Messages**: Pay attention to any error messages displayed by the software. They may provide useful information for troubleshooting specific issues.
4. **Contact Support**: If you are unable to resolve the problem, reach out to the software developer's support team for further assistance.
